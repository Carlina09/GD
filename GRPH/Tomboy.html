      <div class="r"><p1>We all know that Coco Chanel became famous for liberating women from corsets and long uncomfortable skirts, by offering them cozy knits and trousers instead. But not a lot of people know about another style icon from the US that was probably the first true Tomboy fashionista. And that is the fearless and groundbreaking aviator Amelia Earhart. 

        Besides achieving several aviation records including becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, she also introduced the world to her unique personal style. A pioneer of the feminine-masculine style, or Tomboy style, she wore pieces like leather bomber jackets, tailored trousers, smart loafers and sleek neckties. While brown, white, tan and black colored clothing made up a majority of her wardrobe, Amelia managed to keep it anything but boring. She wasn’t afraid to wear a monochromatic neutral look or to even mix multiple neutrals together for one stylish outfit. For the 1930s it was considered extravagant. 
        
        Other Tomboy fashion icons that you all probably know were beautiful movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich. Hepburn favored menswear-inspired, collared shirts, blazers, loafers, simple makeup and of course trousers. Marlene Dietrich’s most famous looks were the ones where she wore masculine three-piece suits to create a distinctly androgynous look that helped to revolutionize and redefine women’s fashion. </p1>
